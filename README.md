# MalURL Detector App
___

### Introduction
This is a Flask App that houses the MalURL Detector. It simply takes a URL as input, then based on a set of lexical and reputational features, predicts the maliciousness of the URL. 

For more context around the Mal URL App, please see my other notebooks in the Blue Team Detector repository: https://github.com/alistairwgillespie/blue_team_detection
