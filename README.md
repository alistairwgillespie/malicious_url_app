# MalURL Detector App

### Introduction
___
This is a Flask App that houses the MalURL Detector. The app simply takes a URL as input, then based on the extraction of a set of lexical and reputational features, predicts the maliciousness of the URL. 

For more context around the Mal URL App, please see my other notebooks in the Blue Team Detector repository: https://github.com/alistairwgillespie/blue_team_detection

At this time, the serialised models required to power the classification of URLS are not available via this repo. However, in the future this may change.
